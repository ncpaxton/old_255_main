# README

Welcome to W255 Machine Learning Systems Engineering. The goal of this class is for you to be comfortable with what a production environment might look like for a real-time machine learning API, and additionally to be bootstrapped for any capstone project that requires some similar level of concern.

## Grading

Grading for this class is meant to be informative. We expect people to work in teams and learn from eachother collective. We also expect students to submit their own work; knowing it won't be without information potentially gained from other students. The instructional team does not care whether you work together with your classmates, we care whether you learn how to create, manage, and communicate about a real production environment with other key stakeholder groups such as IT, Operations, DevOps, Software Engineering, etc.

## Labs

Labs are under the labs folder

## Project

Project will be provided in week 9

## Readings

Below are all of the readings for the class. Please read before the associated synchronous class session; however, reading ahead will be beneficial for the class as we get towards the more hands-on 2nd half.

### Supporting Technology to Review

In this seciton we provide training and reading resources for supporting technologies we will be using in this class. There is an expectation that you will learn these tools on an as needed basis to faciliate your work in the class.

Particularly you will need to be or become comfortable with the following:

- `bash`
- `git`
- `python`
  - `FastAPI`
  - `Pydantic`
- `docker`
- Rest API fundamentals
